# Application for working with MySQL - **"SPAN"**
The application will work with a wide range (span) of studied technologies - _**`Python`**_, _**`OOP`**_, _**`SQL`**_, _**`JSON`**_.

The application works with a MySQL database containing tables of departments and employees. It allows you to enter and change data, as well as receive reports on departments and employees.
The application code shows the basic approaches to the development of client-server applications.

Many users can work with the program at the same time.

Forms for working with a list of records provide an overview and the ability to change entities of a certain type available in the database.

When you click on the “Delete” button, the record is deleted after a confirmation request.

Forms for working with a separate record are opened by clicking on the “Add” or “Edit” buttons in the list form. In the add mode, a new record is formed, and in the edit mode, the selected record is read from the server for editing.

The SPAN application in its present form illustrates the solution of the main tasks that arise during the development of client-server applications: entering, viewing and changing data, as well as creating reports. 
Further development of the program may follow the path of working with a large number of tables and improving individual components of the program.
